[**Lexus**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/20693?trk=prof-exp-company-name)

July 2015 ‚Äì May 2016 (11 months)San Francisco Bay Area

As I began 

on September 2015, I had the unique opportunity to learn about the technology aspect of all the variety of vehicles Lexus was carrying at the time. I had to expand my engineering background with the very formal training Lexus sent us to where I was exposed to very interesting, very complex automobile industry mechanical terms to which I was working and were under the supervision of the most qualified engineers from Japan and the United-States of different regions. We 

learnt, acquired, shared, and of course expanded under such super fast environment. I had ongoing exams, tests I had to complete in order to be a Technology Specialist qualified by law. While my time at Lexus of about exactly 10-11 months, I also got to learn more about finance and sales. I was under the supervision and mentorship of the General Manager. As I have already stated: Business is about people, I am excellent at reading individual's minds, I know exactly from the moment they 

stepped-in the store|boutique, I am all about accuracy and of an absolute detail-oriented that I just applied my multi-cultural background as coming from both European and Asian countries, as well as studying for the past 5 years about International Business | Economics, I am just great at understanding social cues to the extreme point I absolutely know what inspires people, what incentivizes them. Working in sales, lessons learnt are that I always have heard the unvoiced questions, I always have anticipated their needs, I always seemed to find the right words, and the right tone, I always find the right phrases to express my feelings to them thus for these specific reasons they were 

comfortably expressing theirs and that is why they were drawn to me. That is my story of how I distinguish myself from the rest of the society.
