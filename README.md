## About Stephanie Acosta

A Quick Trip Through My Life:  

* I grew up in Tahiti  
    + But I never learned how to surf  
* I studied English in Hawaii before coming to San Diego, California for my univisity studies  
    + Again, I did not learn how to surf  
* I lived in San Diego for 6 years.  
    + While in San Diego i went to school at [San Diego Mesa College](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwj39uTQ5OzRAhVGHJQKHcBRC8kQFggaMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sdmesa.edu%2F&usg=AFQjCNEvJtMpEYeKn5GNyoJWSBQX9UJh9A&sig2=q7Oweh7lBU9hapbwCc62tg&bvm=bv.145822982,d.cGc) before finishing my two bachelors at the beautiful [University California San Diego](http://www.sandiego.edu/)   
        + At USD I received degrees in International Business and Economics   
    + Predictably, I did not learn how to surf in San Diego either.   
* In 2015 I moved to San Francisco with my boy friend of 6 years to begin what we hope will be an exciting chapter of our lives.   
* on Dec 11th, 2015: [Jerad Acosta](http://Jerad.xyz) and I were wed in San Diego on a beautiful day in our new home - the city of San Francisco.    
    + Our beloved friend [Matthew Griffin](https://www.facebook.com/0m.0g.0) lead the ceremoney in what become one of our most treasured moments together.
